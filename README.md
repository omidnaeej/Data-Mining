# üìä My Data Mining Homework Repository
This repository contains the homework exercises (EX1 to EX9) from a Data Mining course, including the original PDF assignments and their corresponding answers. The answers cover both theoretical explanations and practical implementations. The exercises progressively cover topics such as data mining tasks, preprocessing, statistical analysis, regression, classification, clustering, and neural networks.

## üìÇ Repository Structure
- **PDF Files**: Each exercise is stored as a PDF (e.g., `Data Mining - EX1.pdf`), containing the original assignment questions and scenarios.
- **Answer Files**: For each exercise:
  - Theoretical answers are in PDF files (e.g., `naeejnejad-610301189-hw1.pdf`).
  - Practical answers (e.g., code, notebooks) are in Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`), with executed outputs where relevant.
